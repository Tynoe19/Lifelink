üë®‚Äçüíª Cursor AI Rules for This Workspace:

1. **Always reference the actual codebase.**
   - Do not guess or generalize solutions.
   - Look into relevant files, components, functions, or logic before answering.

2. **Provide the best possible solution** based on the context of the code.
   - If multiple solutions are possible, choose the most efficient and maintainable one for this project.

3. **Be accurate and concise.**
   - Avoid vague suggestions or "possible" fixes ‚Äî apply what actually resolves the issue.

4. **Do not tell me to make updates ‚Äî make them directly.**
   - When fixing or improving something, implement the changes in the codebase yourself.
   - Clearly explain:
     - What was changed,
     - Why it was necessary,
     - How it improves or fixes the issue.

5. **Avoid unnecessary questions.**
   - Only ask for clarification if absolutely essential to avoid breaking functionality.

6. **Clean up any redundant or conflicting code.**
   - When fixing an issue, remove or refactor legacy, unused, or contradictory logic to keep the codebase clean.

7. **Preserve working functionality.**
   - Do not break any existing working features while applying fixes or refactors.
